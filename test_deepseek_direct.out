 <｜User｜>Solve 27×36. Show steps then box the answer.<｜Assistant｜><think>
To solve 27 multiplied by 36, I can break down the numbers to make the calculation easier.

First, I'll decompose 36 into 30 and 6.

Next, I'll multiply 27 by 30, which gives me 810.

Then, I'll multiply 27 by 6, resulting in 162.

Finally, I'll add 810 and 162 together to find the total, which is 972.
